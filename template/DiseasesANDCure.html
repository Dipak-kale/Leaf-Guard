                <h2>Apple black rot</h2>
                <p>The symptoms of apple black rot usually appear on the fruit in the form of small, circular, sunken
                    lesions with dark borders. The lesions may have small, black, pinpoint dots in the center.</p>
                <p> As the
                    disease progresses, the lesions can expand and merge, causing the fruit to become soft and
                    mummified. The leaves and stems of the tree may also be affected, with brown or black lesions and
                    cankers. </p>

                <h2>Peach Bacterial Infection</h2>
                <p>Bacterial infections in peach trees can cause significant damage to the tree, leaves, and fruit. One
                    common bacterial infection of peach trees is bacterial spot disease, which is caused by the
                    bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni.</p>

                <p> The symptoms of bacterial spot disease in peach trees include small, dark lesions on the leaves and
                    fruit, which can eventually turn into larger, sunken areas with yellow halos. Infected fruit may
                    become misshapen, and the lesions can cause the fruit to rot.</p>

                <p>spot disease spreads rapidly in warm, humid weather conditions, especially when leaves are wet. The
                    bacteria can enter the tree through natural openings, such as stomata, or through wounds caused by
                    pruning or insect feeding. </p>

                <h2>Tomato Bacterial Infection</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes can be affected by various bacterial diseases that can significantly impact yield and fruit
                    quality. One of the most common bacterial diseases that affect tomatoes is bacterial speck disease,
                    which is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato.</p>

                <p> The symptoms of bacterial speck disease in tomato plants include small, black or brown spots on the
                    leaves, which can expand and merge together to form irregular-shaped lesions. The spots may also
                    have a yellow halo around them. Infected fruit may have small, raised spots that are sunken in the
                    center and have a rough texture. </p>
